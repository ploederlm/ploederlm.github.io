I am a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist working in the field of crisis intervention and suicide prevention. I am mainly working in clinical practice but I am also doing research and education.

Besides work I am also a cyclist, love good coffee, nature, photography, and keeper of a small herd of chicken.
